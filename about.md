I'm a technical writer at SUSE. I maintain the documentation for Rancher, a container management platform, as well as K3s and RKE, which are Kubernetes distributions.

I learned how to code in 2016. Since 2018 I've made it a goal to code every day, and I have continued learning web development ever since.

I'm interested in social media problems and Internet problems. I'm convinced the future of humanity depends on whether and how these problems get solved. Which will prevail, good or evil? Truth or lies? Facts or misinformation?

A lot of ink has been spilled on the problems, without enough focus on people who are trying to work toward the solutions. I'm more interested in people who propose solutions, even if they seem far-fetched.
