I hate political news headlines with these words, and more broadly speaking, any Tweet, post, or article that include these words in the title.

These words are usually red flags for overly sensationalized journalism or filler articles that aren’t real news. They are used to tell you what to think and feel instead of letting you draw your own conclusion.

They don't let you decide for yourself whether or not you are offended by something - a word like 'dangerous' in a headline instructs you to be outraged or worried or angry or offended. These articles and posts emotionally manipulate you to justify their own importance.

Every author of an emotionally manipulative post seems to write from the perspective that an emotion only matters if everyone is reacting the same way, or if that reaction is considered the objectively correct reaction. Almost nobody has the backbone to personally own an emotion, to say "I feel scared of what could happen." Everyone has to hide behind a writing style that tells you that YOU should be scared.

I took these titles from the titles of posts in www.reddit.com/r/politics, shortly before I started using a browser extension that redirects me away from that subreddit. Now it will no longer be able to damage my mental health. Yet I still see these words in the wild, in other places on the Internet.

These are the words, broken into categories:


# Words Used for Titles that Do Nothing but Exaggerate Tweets and Politicians' Quotes

- Accuses (Because it's usually not talking about a court case or a legal accusation. It's usually just someone criticizing someone.)
- Attacks/attacking (This is usually not talking about a physical attack. This word is usually just about people criticizing each other. I would allow the word 'attack' to be used if someone is genuinely physically attacked.)
- Blames
- Blasted
- Calls/called/calling (Person A calls Person B a ___)
- Compares (Person A compares Person B to ____)
- Expresses (Because usually a headline about what someone said is not really news.)
- Eviscerated
- Rebuke/rebukes
- Refuses/Refusal (This word implies someone is being difficult or stubborn and that judgment doesn't belong in a headline.)
- Trashes

# Words Used in Titles of Filler Articles about Nothing

- Acknowledges (Because usually a headline about what someone said is not really news.)
- Admits
- Could/can (Usually speculation)
- Predicts (usually speculation)
- Reacts
- Says/said, or a colon. (Because usually a headline about what someone said is not really news. Usually nothing happened except that someone had an opinion.)
- Should (usually opinion)
- The question mark symbol
- “We must” (Because no, we don’t have to do anything just because an opinion article said we do.)
